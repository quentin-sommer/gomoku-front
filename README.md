# Gomoku-front

This is the frontend of a multi-player Go game we implemented in school.
The backend is visible [here](https://github.com/quentin-sommer/gomoku-back)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
You can find the most recent version of the guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

We use yarn to lock dependencies version(`npm i -g yarn`)

* `yarn install`
* `npm start` for local dev on port 3000
* `npm build` to build an optimized bundle in /build
